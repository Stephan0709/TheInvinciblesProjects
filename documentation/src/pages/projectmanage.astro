  <p class="mt-2 text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300">
    We use Scrum because it helps us plan in small steps, deliver usable increments, and adapt when requirements change.
    Our team has used Scrum before, so we are familiar with the cadence and roles. This page explains what Scrum means for us,
    why we chose it, and how we will run it during the project.

  <h2>Why we chose Scrum</h2>
  <p>
    Scrum breaks work into short iterations called Sprints, typically 1 to 2 weeks. Each Sprint ends with a working increment,
    feedback from stakeholders, and a chance to improve our process. This lets us manage uncertainty, keep scope under control,
    and make steady progress without long periods of invisible work.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Short feedback loops:</strong> Sprints end with reviews and demos, so we learn quickly and adjust next steps.</li>
    <li><strong>Clear priorities:</strong> The Product Backlog is ordered; the most valuable items rise to the top.</li>
    <li><strong>Focus:</strong> A Sprint Goal helps the team align and reduces context switching.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous improvement:</strong> Retrospectives give us a structured way to fix blockers and improve teamwork.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Scrum roles in our team</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product Owner (PO):</strong> owns the Product Backlog, clarifies value, accepts work that meets Definition of Done. Works closely with the client.</li>
    <li><strong>Scrum Master (SM):</strong> facilitates events, removes impediments, protects the team from scope churn during the Sprint.</li>
    <li><strong>Developers:</strong> cross functional team members who design, build, test, document, and deliver the increment.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Core artifacts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product Backlog:</strong> ordered list of user stories, bugs, and spikes. Updated continuously.</li>
    <li><strong>Sprint Backlog:</strong> the subset we commit to for the current Sprint, plus a Sprint Goal.</li>
    <li><strong>Increment:</strong> potentially shippable work that meets our Definition of Done.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Events and cadence</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sprint Planning:</strong> pick a Sprint Goal, select top items, break them into tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Daily Scrum (standup):</strong> 15 minutes max. What we did, what we will do, blockers. Update board and plan the day.</li>
    <li><strong>Sprint Review:</strong> demo the increment, gather feedback, adjust the Product Backlog.</li>
    <li><strong>Retrospective:</strong> discuss what went well, what to improve, and choose 1 to 2 concrete actions for the next Sprint.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How we apply Scrum in this project</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sprint length:</strong> 1 week during high activity; 2 weeks if workload is heavy or exams overlap.</li>
    <li><strong>Backlog tool:</strong> GitHub Projects or Issues. Each item links to a branch and PR.</li>
    <li><strong>Branch strategy:</strong> feature branches &rarr; dev &rarr; main (documented on the Methodology page).</li>
    <li><strong>Definition of Ready:</strong> user story has a clear value statement, acceptance criteria, and test ideas.</li>
    <li><strong>Definition of Done:</strong> code reviewed, tests passing, docs updated (user docs or API notes), deployed to dev if applicable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Pros and cons we accept</h2>
  <div class="grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2 not-prose">
    <div class="rounded-2xl border border-emerald-300/50 bg-emerald-50 dark:bg-emerald-900/20 p-4">
      <h3 class="font-semibold text-emerald-800 dark:text-emerald-200">Pros</h3>
      <ul class="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 text-sm">
        <li>Frequent feedback keeps the product aligned with client needs.</li>
        <li>Small batches reduce risk and make scope changes manageable.</li>
        <li>Visible progress through demos and burn charts keeps morale up.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="rounded-2xl border border-rose-300/50 bg-rose-50 dark:bg-rose-900/20 p-4">
      <h3 class="font-semibold text-rose-800 dark:text-rose-200">Cons</h3>
      <ul class="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 text-sm">
        <li>Meetings can feel heavy if we do not timebox and prepare.</li>
        <li>Poorly written stories slow the team and create rework.</li>
        <li>Too much scope change mid Sprint hurts focus.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Risks and our mitigations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Unclear stories:</strong> we require acceptance criteria and a quick example before pulling a story into a Sprint.</li>
    <li><strong>Scope creep:</strong> changes wait for the next Sprint unless they are critical. The PO updates priority between Sprints.</li>
    <li><strong>Overcommitment:</strong> we track historical velocity and reserve buffer for bug fixes and integration issues.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication gaps:</strong> daily standup is mandatory during Sprints; decisions captured in the docs site.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Working agreements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Standup is 15 minutes max. Deep dives happen after the call with only the people needed.</li>
    <li>Keep stories small. If work is larger than 2 to 3 days, split it.</li>
    <li>Every PR links to a story and includes a brief test plan or screenshots.</li>
    <li>Finish started work before starting new work to reduce WIP.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Lightweight flow</h2>
  <pre class="not-prose rounded-xl bg-slate-900 text-white p-4 text-sm overflow-auto">
Backlog grooming -> Sprint planning -> Build -> Daily standups
-> Code review and tests -> Sprint review demo -> Retrospective
-> Next Sprint
  </pre>

    We reviewed several Scrum overviews to shape this process, including articles that discuss advantages, disadvantages, and typical pitfalls of Scrum. Prior team experience also influenced our choices.
